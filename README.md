# MyFayette - A First Stab at an Ionic Mobile App

Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be attempting to create a very basic business listings mobile app, using the Ionic Framework. This is my first attempt at using Ionic and I'm relying heavily on Thinkster's [Ionic Tutorial](https://thinkster.io/ionic-framework-tutorial#starting-our-project) 
for inspiration and instructions on how to get this off the ground. I'd highly recommend that anyone starting out with Ionic also refer to that tutorial. Once the project is complete, I'll edit the README to reflect download instructions
and final thoughts on the framework.
